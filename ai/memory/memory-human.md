 Initial prompt 

I want to develop a strategy for research support of Square One Coffee (https://www.square1coffee.ca/) a chain of coffee shops in Edmonton Alberta. My research group would like to approach SOC to offer them services on marketing research and support the staff with transition to AI-supported information services (accounting, logistics, staffing, planning, promotion, etc.). Help me systematize knowledge about the vendor, the business, the sector,  the location. Think of ideas for development, opportuinities of the market, etc. I want to modify the documentation in this repo to replace boilerplate text and populate it with project-specific information (e.g. ai/project, ./README.md, etc.)

 Let's build a shiny app (see examples https://shiny.posit.co/r/gallery/ and have https://mastering-shiny.org/ for a go-to reference). Let's start by creating a very simple ux (similar to https://shiny.posit.co/r/gallery/education/ncaa-swim-team-finder/, but simpler), in which the main area would show the map of greater edmonton area with outline of all neighbourhoods. The left-side panel should contain a single drop down box (preferable so you can type in to search) with all the neighbourhoods in greater edmonton area. When a user selects a neighbourhood from the drop-down, the map should highlight the perimeter of the selected neighbourhood. Let's start with this basic functionality and then we can build on it further. Please provide the R code for this initial version of the app.
